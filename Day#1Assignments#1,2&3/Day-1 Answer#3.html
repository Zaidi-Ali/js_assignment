Data Types:
1)String 
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:
ex:
var a = 'Hi there!';
var b = "Hi there!"; 

2)Number
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation .
ex:
var a = 25;         
var b = 80.5; 

3)Boolean
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:
ex:
var isReading = true;       			  // yes, I'm reading
var isSleeping = false;                                                          // no, I'm not sleeping

4)Undefined
The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
ex:
var a;
var b = "Hello World!"
 
alert(a)				 	// Output: undefined
alert(b) 					// Output: Hello World!

5)Null
This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.
ex:
var a = null;
alert(a); 						// Output: null
 
var b = "Hello World!"
alert(b); 						// Output: Hello World!
 
b = null;
alert(b) 						// Output: null


6)Object Data type
The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.
The following example will show you the simplest way to create an object in JavaScript.
ex:
var emptyObject = {};
var person = {"name": "Ali", "surname": Zaidi", "age": "21"};
 
// For better reading

var car = {
    "modal": "BMW X3",
    "color": "white",
    "doors": 5
}

7)Array
An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].
The simplest way to create an array is by specifying the array elements as a comma-separated list enclosed by square brackets, as shown in the example below:
ex:
var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];
var cities = ["London", "Paris", "New York"];
 
alert(colors[0]);   					// Output: Red
alert(cities[2]);   					// Output: New York
